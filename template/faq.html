<a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://twitter.com/david_a_eaves">David Eaves</a> blogged about <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://eaves.ca/2009/06/29/how-open-data-even-makes-garbage-collection-sexier-easier-and-cheaper/">the idea</a>. Later at a <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="https://vancouver.hackspace.ca/doku.php?id=super_happy_hacker_house">community hackathon</a> <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://twitter.com/lukec">Luke Closs</a> and <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://twitter.com/kevinj">Kevin Jones</a> decided it might be a fun project.</p>
<p>
With an initial prototype in hand we sat down for some <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://socialtext.net/vantrash">lightweight project planning</a>. And then we built the site on a few weekends and evenings.</p>
<h2 id="why_was_vantrash_created">Why was VanTrash created?</h2>
<p>
Mostly because it should exist. But also because we wanted to show city councils around the world the services, resources and ingenuity that can unleashed when cities open up and share their data. This is our small example.</p>
<h2 id="where_does_the_data_come_from_is_this_official">Where does the data come from? Is this official?</h2>
<p>
The data used by VanTrash is &quot;scraped&quot; from the Official City site here: <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://vancouver.ca/ENGSVCS/solidwaste/garbage/collectsched.htm">http://vancouver.ca/ENGSVCS/solidwaste/garbage/collectsched.htm</a></p>

<p>
At the bottom of the email you got when you created the reminder, there is a link to delete it. If you are really stuck, please contact us.</p>
<h2 id="i_would_love_to_see_a_vantrash_in_my_city_will_you_create_one_can_i_create_one">I would love to see a VanTrash in my city, will you create one, can I create one?</h2>
<p>
It&#39;s certainly possible! The code that runs vantrash.ca is under an <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://github.com/lukec/vantrash/raw/master/LICENSE">open source license</a> and it is up on <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://github.com/lukec/vantrash/tree/master">Github</a>.</p>
<p>
We haven&#39;t tried to build things we don&#39;t need yet, but we have an idea for re-using this software. We should really write more about this, so please harass us to do so.</p>
<h2 id="i_work_for_a_city_and_would_like_to_help_create_this_service_for_our_city_what_should_i_do">I work for a city and would like to help create this service for our city, what should I do?</h2>
<p>
If you are an employee of a city and would like us to create this service for your city we would be very interested in talking to you. Please contact us <a href="mailto:info@vantrash.ca">here</a>.</p>
<p>
As a first step, we would encourage you to share your garbage collections maps and schedule with the public in an open standard - we would be happy to talk to you about what that would look like.</p>
<h2 id="what_kind_of_technology_does_this_site_use">What kind of technology does this site use?</h2>
<p>
Luke and Kevin are Perl and Javascript hackers, so we have a trimmed down Nginx/Apache2/mod_perl2/HTTP::Engine/SQLite backend, <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> in the browser, and <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://twitter.com/miyagawa">Miyagawa</a>&#39;s excellent <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Emiyagawa/Web-Scraper/">Web::Scraper</a> module to consume the schedule from the City&#39;s website.</p>
<p>
The code is all up on github: <a target="_blank" title="(external link)" href="http://github.com/lukec/vantrash">http://github.com/lukec/vantrash</a>. Patches welcome.</p>
